# Pewlett Hackard Analysis with PostgreSQL

## I. Overview of Project

### Background
Pewlett Hackard is a large company with a huge number of employees. The company has been around for a long time and baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate. I have been working on this project to help Pewlett Hackard to get ready for the future by analyzing employee data using SQL. 
The company has been relying on Excel in the past, so the first step is to build an employee data base with SQL by creating 6 tables to hold the csv files: departments, employees, dept_manager, dept_emp, titles and salaries. ([Pewlett_Hackard Data](https://github.com/weihaolun/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/tree/main/Analysis%20Projects%20Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis%20Folder/Data/Pewlett_Hackard%20Data))

Then, I used SQL queries to further analyze the data and created tables and csv data files to hold all retiring employees’ information: retirement_info, dept_count, emp_info, manager_info, dept_info and current_emp. ([Pewlett_Hackard Data](https://github.com/weihaolun/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/tree/main/Analysis%20Projects%20Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis%20Folder/Data/Pewlett_Hackard%20Data)) These data are very helpful for the company to conclude results such as who are retiring, which departments have the most retiring employees, how many management team members are retiring etc.

After above analysis, I am conducting another challenge to further help Pewlett Hackard to prepare for the upcoming “silver tsunami” as many current employees reaching retirement age.


### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to:

1.	Determine the retiring employees and the number of retiring employees per title.
2.	Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
3.	Summarize and analyze how to prepare for the “silver tsunami”.
